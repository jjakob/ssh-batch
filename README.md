To automatically run on boot, create a systemd service:
```
root@host:~# cat > /etc/systemd/system/ssh-batch@.service <<-'EOF'
	[Unit]
	Description=Run a batch of commands via SSH
	After=network-online.target

	RemainAfterExit=true
	# add -v if you want the entire ssh session to be logged in the journal
	ExecStart=ssh-batch "%E/%p/%i_prompt" "%E/%p/%i" -o BatchMode=yes "%i"
	
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
